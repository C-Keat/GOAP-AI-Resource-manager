# GOAP-AI-Resource-manager

The aim of this project is to create an organised and smart RTS game AI, using the agile
development methodology as well as UML modelling, that is able to make intelligent
decisions based on what its current state is and if there is any input from a player, in order to
create a reliable and robust economy.


This represents my final years project, where I was able to succesfully create a Goal orantated action planning AI, with the possibility to be expanded.
